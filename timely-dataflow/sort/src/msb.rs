//! Most-significant bit (MSB) radix sorting.
//!
//! MSB radix sorting works by partitioning elements first by their highest byte, and then recursively
//! processing each part. Our plan is to do this in a depth-first manner, to minimize the outlay of
//! partially empty buffers and such.
//!
//! One advantage of MSB radix sorting is that we can stop at any point and fall into a traditional sort
//! implementation. I expect this to be useful, in that many instances of radix sorting are based on a
//! hash of keys, and still require a final sort in any case.
//!
//! This advantage is likely also an important performance detail: we should eventually fall into a more
//! traditional sort if the number of elements becomes small, as our implementation will have non-trivial
//! (i.e. 256) overhead for each invocation. Once we have less than some fixed amount of work (e.g. one
//! buffer's full of elements) we should fall into the final sort.

/// A "most-significant byte" (MSB) radix sorter.
///
/// This type manages buffers and provides logic for sorting batches of records using binary keys, in a
/// "top down" or "most-significant byte" manner. One advantage of this approach is that it can exit early
/// if batch sizes become small, avoiding radix scans over the data.
///
/// The type also allows the user to hook this the early exit functionality, as the finalizing action before
/// the early exit can be a great time to consolidate or deduplicate records if this is desired, and can be
/// much more efficient than trying to do the same after the fact (often the radix key is not the true key,
/// and one must re-sort by the actual key). See the `finish_into_and` and `sort_and` methods.
